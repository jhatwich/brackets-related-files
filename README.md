brackets-related-files
========================

"Related Files" for Brackets.  This extension scans files when they are opened/added to the working set and builds
a list of related files in the project.  You can fold down the related files via a discloser to the right of 
working set files and can open the related files from there.

The list of related files is determined by searching a document for relative paths to each of the files in a project.
A few tweaks are in place so that it can find requires in JavaScript.
